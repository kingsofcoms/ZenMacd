## Disclaimer

- Zenbot is NOT a sure-fire profit machine. Use it AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- Crypto-currency is still an experiment, and therefore so is Zenbot. Meaning, both may fail at any time.
- Running a bot, and trading in general requires careful study of the risks and parameters involved. A wrong setting can cause you a major loss.
- Never leave the bot un-monitored for long periods of time. Zenbot doesn't know when to stop, so be prepared to stop it if too much loss occurs.
- Often times the default trade parameters will underperform vs. a buy-hold strategy, so run some simulations and find the optimal parameters for your chosen exchange/pair before going "all-in".

## Quick-start

### 1. Requirements: Windows, Linux or OSX or Docker, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and Python3.

### 2. Install zenbot 4:

Run in your console,

```
git clone https://github.com/TheRoboKitten/zenmacd.git
```

Then run:
```
sudo sh setup.sh
```

Make sure to input your poloniex API KEY and HASH into conf-example.js


Follow the on-screen instructions, make sure to read README.md


### Running:

To run do:

```
sudo python3 macdtrader.py
```
It will be filling the database on the first rounds, and updates every round and each coin... Can be slow, but can be very profitable from the looks of it.
